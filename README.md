# TenArcs

## Abstract

An n-arc in the projective plane over a finite field is a collection of n distinct points in the plane, no three of which lie on a line. Formulae for the number of n-arcs in P<sup>2</sup>(F<sub>q</sub>) are known only through n = 9. Building on the work of D. Glynn, we exhibit the 151 unique projective [10<sub>3</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>]-superfigurations, and find conditions on q which determine the number of occurrences of each in P<sup>2</sup>(F<sub>q</sub>). Using these results, we determine an expression for the number of 10-arcs in P<sup>2</sup>(F<sub>q</sub>).
